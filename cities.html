<h1>Top 3 cities I've called home</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Seattle $$$$</li>
    <li>Portland $$$</li>
    <li>San Francisco $$$$$</li>
</ul>
<p>I visited Seattle in May, it was super beautiful, and got tricked into living there. I lived in
    Chicago after returning to the US from living in Bali for a half-year. I moved to San 
    Francisco because I felt the pull of Silicon valley</p>

<h1>Top 3 cities I'd like to visit</h1>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Zürichs <span>&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;</span></strong></li>
    <li><em>London <span>&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;&euro;</span></em></li>
    <li><strong>Istanbul <span>&euro;&euro;</span></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I have some good friends who live in Switzerland and I hope they show me around Zurich.
    On the way to Zürich, I'd like to spend a week exploring London and its history. And after
    Zurich, I'd love to stuff my face with amazing food from Istanbul.</p>
